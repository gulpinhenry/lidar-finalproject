        <h3>What is LiDAR?</h3>
        <p class="flow-text">
          Light Detection and Ranging (LiDar), is a method of range finding that
          scientists from all fields have been using. From building
          topographical maps to even improving augmented reality, LiDAR is
          certainly an important cross-section between physics and computer
          science and many other related fields. Similar to sonar and radar,
          which use sound and radio waves respectively, LiDAR instead utilizes
          the speed of light as well as time to calculate how far away something
          is. LiDAR machines send out pulses of lasers to calculate the time
          elapsed as the laser beams bounce back to the machine. This allows for
          computers to be able to render 3D surfaces of a particular
          environment.
          <br />
          LiDAR machines typically utilize three main components: a GPS
          receiver, a scanner, and a laser. Although many of these machines can
          be found in airplanes and cars, they can also be found inside the
          latest phones. These devices use light waves past the eye’s visible
          spectrum, which also implies that LiDAR can also be used in the dark
          as well.

            Let’s say I was in a self driving car. In order for me to drive
            safely, I would need to have a precise model of what my surroundings
            look like. This is where LiDAR works fantastically. For LiDAR to
            work, I will emit pulses of light waves from my vehicle in all
            directions. Soon, the light will bounce off an object blocking the
            lights path, and the sensor will be notified of this reflection. And
            through simple kinematics (explained below), a computer can compute
            how far away the surroundings are based on how long it took for the
            light to be reflected. If this process is repeatedly executed in
            real time, the computer is able to generate a rough map of its
            surroundings.

              <h4>Case: Topographic LiDAR</h4>
              <p>
                One prominent application of LiDAR is to examine tree growth,
                perhaps utilizing the density of trees to predict forest fires
                or give certain estimates on carbon emissions and other
                ecological data. In this case, planes with LiDAR machines use
                infrared lasers to efficiently scan through an entire forest
                instead of needing many people to manually estimate regions of
                forest.

              <h4>Case: iPhone Face ID</h4>
              <p>
                LiDAR can also be found in daily devices like facial recognition
                features. With LiDAR, the phone is able to create a scan of
                facial features to recognize the phone’s owner.

                Much of LiDAR’s basic functionality has to do with the
                kinematics we’ve learned in class. We learned that velocity is
                equal the rate of change and direction of an object with respect
                to time. Because the speed of light is constant (299 792 458 m /
                s), and our machine can calculate the time it took for the light
                wave to reflect, we can multiply the speed of light with the
                time to get the distance the light traveled, to get an accurate
                prediction of how far something is from the LiDAR machine.

              <img src= "./images/doppler.jpg"/>
              <p>
                Because most LiDAR machines are utilized on non-stationary
                machines, a unique property called the doppler effect arises.
                Because the light waves pulse with the same frequency from the
                machine, but the machine itself is moving. Thus there will be a
                change in relative velocity and thus a change in frequency in
                the observer’s frame of reference. A real life example of this
                is when a racecar roars by and you can hear the change in pitch
                of the car engine. As the car approaches you with a velocity the
                frequency of the pulses increase thus generating a higher pitch.

                Light travels undergoing simple harmonic motion, or SHM for
                short. SHM is a type of motion where these waves oscillate
                around a center, like a pendulum, or in more specific terms,
                when the acceleration of the particle or wave is directly
                proportional to its center (mean position). Because there are
                other light waves while the LiDAR machine is operating, there
                can be constructive and destructive interference, where waves
                become superimposed. Sometimes they can cancel out, like white
                noise, or even amplify the wave, like combining music speakers.
